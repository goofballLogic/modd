      <p>
        Domain-driven design is a powerful tool for the creation of software libraries and applications. It ensures that clean design follows from a clean definition of services and their domains.
        However, it is often (though not exclusively) associated with class-oriented languages and paradigms, where entities are represented by classes (C#, Java), or struct types with methods (Go etc.).
        The goal of this repository is to explore the potential for implementing domain-driven design concepts using Javascript's rich function-oriented paradigm.

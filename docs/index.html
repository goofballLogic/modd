    <p>Message oriented domain design using javascript functions as first-class aggregate roots / entities</p>
  </header>
  <main>

    <p>
      The technique described on this site attempts to extrapolate Alan Kay's concept of biological (cellular) automota
      coordinating their behaviour by means of message exchange.
      The site describes terms such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a>domain</a></li>
      <li><a>bounded context</a></li>
      <li><a>aggregate root</a></li>
      <li><a>entity</a></li>
      <li><a>value</a></li>
      <li><a>factory</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These concepts are used widely in Domain Driven Design (DDD) but the chosen characteristics (both strategic and
      tactical) are specific to DDD.
      <br />
      <br />
      Below, I define the strategic characteristics of the each concept as applied to this technique.
      I point out similarities and differences between this technique and DDD.
      I also include some some initial hints of tactical patterns used to apply them.
    </p>

    <h2>Concepts differing widely from DDD counterparts</h2>

    <h3>Domain</h3>
    <p>
      Within DDD, there is a focus on defining a clear domain expressed in a ubiquitous language (and a corresponding
      <em>domain model</em>).
      Often the desire for a cleanly-modelled domain pushes parts of the implementation outside of the domain model -
      e.g. "infrastructure" or "UI".
      The technique described in this site explicitly demands that the "core" domain encompasses the entirety of the
      implementation.
    </p>

    <h3>Entity</h3>
    <p>
      An entity is is the locus of all behaviour.
      An entity is something which has a unique identity due <em>only</em> to how it behaves.
      Although entities produced by the same factory may behave similarly, they are distinguished by internal state
      which causes them to respond in a unique way to messages which they receive.
      <br />
      <br />
      An entity should usually not be identifiable other than by the way it behaves in response to messages.
      The goal of this techinque is for entities to collaborate <em>purely</em> via message exchange.
      Entities are expected to detect messages emitted by other entities and decide whether or not to act upon those
      messages.
    </p>

    <h3>Value</h3>
    <p>
      Like DDD value objects, value objects are entirely defined by the value of their attributes.
      Values may not exhibit behaviours (beyond the representation of their data).
      <br />
      <br />
      Unlike DDD, a value object may be an identifiable piece of data with its own identity, specified by one or more
      attributes (acting as a key).
      <br />
      <br />
      Values are frequently used as the value-bearing portion of a <a>message</a> which can received or emitted by an
      entity.
    </p>

    <h2>Concepts similar to DDD</h2>

    <h3>Aggregate root</h3>
    <p>
      Similar to DDD, aggregate roots are entities which are responsible for the coordination of other entities
      via (re-)distribution of messages to entities contained within the aggregate.
    </p>
    <h3>Bounded context</h3>
    <p>Like DDD, a bounded context represents the chosen boundary within which to implement one or more parts of a
      domain.
      <br />
      <br />
      Each message belongs to a bounded context and its meaning is defined by its owning context.
      Messages exchanged by contexts are often handled by a single entity which is responsible for marshalling external
      messages.
      <br />
      <br />
      Messages owned by a bounded context are intended to flow freely within a bounded context, but not within other
      bounded contexts.
    </p>
    <h4>Lack of source-code segregation</h4>
    <p>
      It should be noted that using this technique, bounded contexts may reuse entities and values found in other
      contexts.
      This is because a bounded context is modelled as a <em>run-time</em> structure of objects (not statically defined
      folders, files, factories or classes/functions)
    </p>
    <h3>Factory</h3>
    <p>
      Factories are used to create Entities and Aggregate Roots. Without Factories it is not possible to instantiate
      Entities.
    </p>

    <h2>What is a message?</h2>
    <h3>Message</h3>
    <p>
      A message is a signal sent to/from an entity and/or aggregate root.
      It is similar to the concept of an "event" or "Domain Event" in DDD in that it usually describes something
      which has happened.
      However, messages are the bread-and-butter of this technique.
      They are not reserved for course-grained interactions.
      <br />
      <br />
      A message consists of two parts:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Message type</li>
      <li>Message values</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Message types are represented by unique values (JavaScript symbols, URLs and UUIDs are all potential
      implementation options).
      <br />
      <br />
      Message values are plain data structures without any behaviour (JSON documents, JSON-LD docments and plain-old
      JavaScript objects which can be created by hydrating JSON, are all good candidates.)
